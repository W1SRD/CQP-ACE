1. Enabling MySQL to read files using the MySQL infile loader

The user loading must have the file priviledge.
Apparmor or simlilar must be configured to allow the mysqld process to read files from the directory where the logs are placed.
On Ubuntu, cd /etc/apparmor.d, sudo vi usr/sbin/mysqld and add /tmp/** r in the list of directories.
Example to load files from the /tmp directory:
...
/var/lib/mysql/ r,
...
/var/log/mysql/ r,
/var/log/mysql/* rw,
/tmp/** r,
..

An alternative is to place the log files in a directory with read access already defined, for example /var/lib/mysql/.
