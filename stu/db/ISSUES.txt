When issues are resolved, move them down below the second heading.

List of unresolved issues
=========================
* Do the # of CW, Phone, and Total QSOs need to be stored in the DB or
  recalculated.
* Do the # of mults need to be stored or are they easily generated.
* Should the time to 58 be stored or recalculated every time
* How is the best mobile calculated
* For the "first to 58" thing, it would be useful to have some data about
  the current running of the contest
  Table=CONTEST
     NAME VARCHAR(32),
     YEAR INT,
     START DATETIME,
     END   DATETIME
  This would also be useful to identify QSOs out of bounds when we redo GREEN.
