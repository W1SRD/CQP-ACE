This is the initial set of tests for QSO matching.

Files (Apply in this order)

qso.sql 		Creates the initial qso table in the DB
rxi.sql			Creates the rxi table used by rule1-ok.sql
loadqso.sql		Loads all QSO records from qsorecs.dbl into qso
postloadnorm.sql	Normalizes qso.freq into bands rather than MHz
findnonnorm.sql		Select to find remaining records not normalized
			Finish these off by hand
insertrxi.sql		Load the rxi table with freq/mode/day/tod + rx fields
indexrxi.sql		Build compund index on rxi with all fields
rule1-ok.sql		Applies rule 1 as a select

dropall.sql		Drops the tables qso and rxi

These will all be automated by a PHP script using PDO to access a MYSQL 
database.

MYSQL is preferred over SQLite as the latter is quite limiting in many
respects.

These scripts should work on either as long as wildcard characters are
mapped in postloadnorm.sql.
